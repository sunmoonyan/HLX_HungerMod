# HLX_HungerMod V1.0
HLX Hunger Mod adds a hunger and energy system to the Helix framework. Eating restores both hunger and satiety points. Satiety depletes firstâ€”while you have satiety, your health regenerates. Once satiety runs out, the hunger bar starts to decrease, and when it reaches zero, you begin to lose health.
Energy is another system related to stamina. The HungerMod also adds drinks that can restore health and provide "energy." Energy temporarily doubles your stamina for a period of time.
